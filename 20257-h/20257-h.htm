<h2>A P<small>OLITICAL</small> R<small>OMANCE</small>,
&amp;C.</h2>

<p class="letter">
SIR,
</p>

<p>
In my last, for want of something better to write about, I told you what a
World of Fending and Proving we have had of late, in this little Village of
ours, about an <i>old-cast-Pair-of-black-Plush-Breeches</i>, which <i>John</i>,
our Parish-Clerk, about ten Years ago, it seems, had made a Promise of to one
<i>Trim</i>, who is our Sexton and Dog-Whipper.&mdash;To this you write me
Word, that you have had more than either one or two Occasions to know a good
deal of the shifty Behaviour of this said Master <i>Trim</i>,&mdash;and that
you are astonished, nor can you for your Soul conceive, how so worthless a
Fellow, and so worthless a Thing into the Bargain, could become the Occasion of
such a Racket as I have represented.
</p>

<p>
Now, though you do not say expressly, you could wish to hear any more about it,
yet I see plain enough that I have raised your Curiosity; and therefore, from
the same Motive, that I slightly mentioned it at all in my last Letter, I will,
in this, give you a full and very circumstantial Account of the whole Affair.
</p>

<p>
But, before I begin, I must first set you right in one very material Point, in
which I have misled you, as to the true Cause of all this Uproar amongst
us;&mdash;which does not take its Rise, as I then told you, from the Affair of
the <i>Breeches;</i>&mdash;but, on the contrary, the whole Affair of the
<i>Breeches</i> has taken its Rise from it:&mdash;To understand which, you must
know, that the first Beginning of the Squabble was not between <i>John</i> the
Parish-Clerk and <i>Trim</i> the Sexton, but betwixt the Parson of the Parish
and the said Master Trim, about an old <i>Watch-Coat</i>, which had many Years
hung up in the Church, which <i>Trim</i> had set his Heart upon; and nothing
would serve <i>Trim</i> but he must take it home, in order to have it converted
into a <i>warm Under-Petticoat</i> for his Wife, and a <i>Jerkin</i> for
himself, against Winter; which, in a plaintive Tone, he most humbly
begg&rsquo;d his Reverence would consent to.
</p>

<p>
I need not tell you, Sir, who have so often felt it, that a Principle of strong
Compassion transports a generous Mind sometimes beyond what is strictly
right,&mdash;the Parson was within an Ace of being an honourable Example of
this very Crime;&mdash;for no sooner did the distinct
Words&mdash;<i>Petticoat&mdash;poor Wife&mdash;warm&mdash;Winter</i> strike
upon his Ear, but his Heart warmed,&mdash;and, before <i>Trim</i> had well got
to the End of his Petition, (being a Gentleman of a frank and open Temper) he
told him he was welcome to it, with all his Heart and Soul. But, <i>Trim</i>,
says he, as you see I am but just got down to my Living, and am an utter
Stranger to all Parish-Matters, know nothing about this old Watch-Coat you beg
of me, having never seen it in my Life, and therefore cannot be a Judge whether
&rsquo;tis fit for such a Purpose; or, if it is, in Truth, know not whether
&rsquo;tis mine to bestow upon you or not;&mdash;you must have a Week or ten
Days Patience, till I can make some Inquiries about it;&mdash;and, if I find it
is in my Power, I tell you again, Man, your Wife is heartily welcome to an
Under-Petticoat out of it, and you to a Jerkin, was the Thing as good again as
you represent it.
</p>

<p>
It is necessary to inform you, Sir, in this Place, That the Parson was
earnestly bent to serve <i>Trim</i> in this Affair, not only from the Motive of
Generosity, which I have justly ascribed to him, but likewise from another
Motive; and that was by way of making some Sort of Recompence for a Multitude
of small Services which <i>Trim</i> had occasionally done, and indeed was
continually doing, (as he was much about the House) when his own Man was out of
the Way. For all these Reasons together, I say, the Parson of the Parish
intended to serve <i>Trim</i> in this Matter to the utmost of his Power: All
that was wanting was previously to inquire, if any one had a <i>Claim</i> to
it;&mdash;or whether, as it had, Time immemorial, hung up in the Church, the
taking it down might not raise a Clamour in the Parish. These Inquiries were
the very Thing that <i>Trim</i> dreaded in his Heart&mdash;He knew very well
that if the Parson should but say one Word to the Church-Wardens about it,
there would be an End of the whole Affair. For this, and some other Reasons not
necessary to be told you, at present, <i>Trim</i> was for allowing no Time in
this Matter;&mdash;but, on the contrary, doubled his Diligence and Importunity
at the Vicarage-House;&mdash;plagued the whole Family to Death;&mdash;pressed
his Suit Morning, Noon, and Night; and, to shorten my Story, teazed the poor
Gentleman, who was but in an ill State of Health, almost out of his Life about
it.
</p>

<p>
You will not wonder, when I tell you, that all this Hurry and Precipitation, on
the Side of Master <i>Trim</i>, produced its natural Effect on the Side of the
Parson, and that was, a Suspicion that all was not right at the Bottom.
</p>

<p>
He was one Evening sitting alone in his Study, weighing and turning this Doubt
every Way in his Mind; and, after an Hour and a half&rsquo;s serious
Deliberation upon the Affair, and running over <i>Trim</i>&rsquo;s Behaviour
throughout,&mdash;he was just saying to himself, <i>It must be
so;</i>&mdash;when a sudden Rap at the Door put an End to his
Soliloquy,&mdash;and, in a few Minutes, to his Doubts too; for a Labourer in
the Town, who deem&rsquo;d himself past his fifty-second Year, had been
returned by the Constable in the Militia-List,&mdash;and he had come, with a
Groat in his Hand, to search the Parish Register for his Age.&mdash;The Parson
bid the poor Fellow put the Groat into his Pocket, and go into the
Kitchen:&mdash;Then shutting the Study Door, and taking down the Parish
Register,&mdash;<i>Who knows</i>, says he, <i>but I may find something here
about this self-same Watch-Coat?</i>&mdash;He had scarce unclasped the Book, in
saying this, when he popp&rsquo;d upon the very Thing he wanted, fairly wrote
on the first Page, pasted to the Inside of one of the Covers, whereon was a
Memorandum about the very Thing in Question, in these express Words:
</p>

<h5>MEMORANDUM.</h5>

<p>
<b>The great Watch-Coat was purchased and given above two hundred years ago, by
the Lord of the Manor, to this Parish-Church, to the sole use and Behoof of the
poor sextons thereof, and their Sucessors, for ever, to be Worn by them
respectively in wintery cold Nights, in ringing</b> Complines, Passing-Bells,
&amp;c. <b>which the said Lord of the manor had done, in Piety, to keep the
poor Wretches warm, and for the Good of his own Soul, for Which they were
directed to pray,</b> &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. <i>Just Heaven!</i> said
the Parson to himself, looking upwards, <i>What an Escape have I had! Give this
for an Under-Petticoat to Trim&rsquo;s Wife! I would not have consented to such
a Desecration to be Primate of all England; nay, I would not have
disturb&rsquo;d a single Button of it for half my Tythes!</i>
</p>

<p>
Scarce were the Words out of his Mouth, when in pops <i>Trim</i> with the whole
Subject of the Exclamation under both his Arms.&mdash;I say, under both his
Arms;&mdash;for he had actually got it ripp&rsquo;d and cut out ready, his own
Jerkin under one Arm, and the Petticoat under the other, in order to be carried
to the Taylor to be made up,&mdash;and had just stepp&rsquo;d in, in high
Spirits, to shew the Parson how cleverly it had held out.
</p>

<p>
There are many good Similies now subsisting in the World, but which I have
neither Time to recollect or look for, which would give you a strong Conception
of the Astonishment and honest Indignation which this unexpected Stroke of
<i>Trim</i>&rsquo;s Impudence impress&rsquo;d upon the Parson&rsquo;s
Looks.&mdash;Let it suffice to say, That it exceeded all fair
Description,&mdash;as well as all Power of proper Resentment,&mdash;except
this, that <i>Trim</i> was ordered, in a stern Voice, to lay the Bundles down
upon the Table,&mdash;to go about his Business, and wait upon him, at his
Peril, the next Morning at Eleven precisely,:&mdash;Against this Hour, like a
wise Man, the Parson had sent to desire <i>John</i> the Parish-Clerk, who bore
an exceeding good Character as a Man of Truth, and who having, moreover, a
pretty Freehold of about eighteen Pounds a Year in the Township, was a leading
Man in it; and, upon the whole, was such a one of whom it might be
said,&mdash;That he rather did Honour to his Office,&mdash;than that his Office
did Honour to him.&mdash;Him he sends for, with the Church-Wardens, and one of
the Sides-Men, a grave, knowing, old Man, to be present:&mdash;For as
<i>Trim</i> had withheld the whole Truth from the Parson, touching the
Watch-Coat, he thought it probable he would as certainly do the same Thing to
others; though this, I said, was wise, the Trouble of the Precaution might have
been spared, &mdash;because the Parson&rsquo;s Character was
unblemish&rsquo;d,&mdash;and he had ever been held by the World in the
Estimation of a Man of Honour and Integrity.&mdash;<i>Trim</i>&rsquo;s
Character, on the contrary, was as well known, if not in the World, yet, at
least, in all the Parish, to be that of a little, dirty, pimping, pettifogging,
ambidextrous Fellow,&mdash;who neither cared what he did or said of any,
provided he could get a Penny by it.&mdash;This might, I say, have made any
Precaution needless;&mdash;but you must know, as the Parson had in a Manner but
just got down to his Living, he dreaded the Consequences of the least ill
Impression on his first Entrance amongst his Parishioners, which would have
disabled him from doing them the Good he Wished;&mdash;so that, out of Regard
to his Flock, more than the necessary Care due to himself,&mdash;he was
resolv&rsquo;d not to lie at the Mercy of what Resentment might vent, or Malice
lend an Ear to.&mdash;Accordingly the whole Matter was rehearsed from first to
last by the Parson, in the Manner I&rsquo;ve told you, in the Hearing of
<i>John</i> the Parish-Clerk, and in the Presence of <i>Trim</i>.
</p>

<p>
<i>Trim</i> had little to say for himself, except &ldquo;That the Parson had
absolutely promised to befriend him and his Wife in the Affair, to the utmost
of his Power: That the Watch-Coat was certainly in his Power, and that he might
give it him if he pleased.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
To this, the Parson&rsquo;s Reply was short, but strong, &ldquo;That nothing
was in his Power to do, but what he could do <i>honestly:</i>&mdash;That in
giving the Coat to him and his Wife, he should do a manifest Wrong to the next
Sexton; the great Watch-Coat being the most comfortable Part of the
Place:&mdash;That he should, moreover, injure the Right of his own Successor,
who would be just so much a worse Patron, as the Worth of the Coat amounted
to;&mdash;and, in a Word, he declared, that his whole intent in promising that
Coat, was Charity to <i>Trim;</i> but <i>Wrong</i> to no Man; that was a
Reserve, he said, made in all Cases of this Kind:&mdash;and he declared
solemnly, <i>in Verbo Sacerdotis</i>, That this was his Meaning, and was so
understood by <i>Trim</i> himself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
With the Weight of this Truth, and the great good Sense and strong Reason which
accompanied all the Parson said upon the Subject,&mdash;poor <i>Trim</i> was
driven to his last Shift,&mdash;and begg&rsquo;d he might be suffered to plead
his Right and Title to the Watch-Coat, if not by <i>Promise</i>, at least by
<i>Services</i>.&mdash;It was well known how much he was entitled to it upon
these Scores: That he had black&rsquo;d the Parson&rsquo;s Shoes without Count,
and greased his Boots above fifty Times:&mdash;That he had run for Eggs into
the Town upon all Occasions;&mdash;whetted the Knives at all
Hours;&mdash;catched his Horse and rubbed him down:&mdash;That for his Wife she
had been ready upon all Occasions to charr for them;&mdash;and neither he nor
she, to the best of his Remembrance, ever took a Farthing, or any thing beyond
a Mug of Ale.&mdash;To this Account of his Services he begg&rsquo;d Leave to
add those of his Wishes, which, he said, had been equally great.&mdash;He
affirmed, and was ready, he said, to make it appear, by Numbers of Witnesses,
&ldquo;He had drank his Reverence&rsquo;s Health a thousand Times, (by the bye,
he did not add out of the Parson&rsquo;s own Ale): That he not only drank his
Health, but wish&rsquo;d it; and never came to the House, but ask&rsquo;d his
Man kindly how he did; that in particular, about half a Year ago, when his
Reverence cut his Finger in paring an Apple, he went half a Mile to ask a
cunning Woman, what was good to stanch Blood, and actually returned with a
Cobweb in his Breeches Pocket:&mdash;Nay, says <i>Trim</i>, it was not a
Fortnight ago, when your Reverence took that violent Purge, that I went to the
far End of the whole Town to borrow you a Close-stool,&mdash;and came back, as
my Neighbours, who flouted me, will all bear witness, with the Pan upon my
Head, and never thought it too much.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
<i>Trim</i> concluded his pathetick Remonstrance with saying, &ldquo;He hoped
his Reverence&rsquo;s Heart would not suffer him to requite so many faithful
Services by so unkind a Return:&mdash;That if it was so, as he was the first,
so he hoped he should be the last, Example of a Man of his Condition so
treated.&rdquo;&mdash;This Plan of <i>Trim</i>&rsquo;s Defence, which
<i>Trim</i> had put himself upon,&mdash;could admit of no other Reply but a
general Smile.
</p>

<p>
Upon the whole, let me inform you, That all that could be said, <i>pro</i> and
<i>con</i>, on both Sides, being fairly heard, it was plain, That <i>Trim</i>,
in every Part of this Affair, had behaved very ill;&mdash;and <i>one</i> Thing,
which was never expected to be known of him, happening in the Course of this
Debate to come out against him; namely, That he had gone and told the Parson,
before he had ever set Foot in his Parish, That <i>John</i> his
Parish-Clerk,&mdash;his Church-Wardens, and some of the Heads of the Parish,
were a Parcel of Scoundrels.&mdash;Upon the Upshot, <i>Trim</i> was
kick&rsquo;d out of Doors; and told, at his Peril, never to come there
again.
</p>

<p>
At first <i>Trim</i> huff&rsquo;d and bounced most terribly;&mdash;swore he
would get a Warrant;&mdash;then nothing would serve him but he would call a
Bye-Law, and tell the whole Parish how the Parson had misused him;&mdash;but
cooling of that, as fearing the Parson might possibly bind him over to his good
Behaviour, and, for aught he knew, might send him to the House of
Correction,&mdash;he let the Parson alone; and, to revenge himself, falls foul
upon his Clerk, who had no more to do in the Quarrel than you or I;&mdash;rips
up the Promise of the old-cast-Pair-of-black-Plush-Breeches, and raises an
Uproar in the Town about it, notwithstanding it had slept ten Years.&mdash;But
all this, you must know, is look&rsquo;d upon in no other Light, but as an
artful Stroke of Generalship in <i>Trim</i>, to raise a Dust, and cover himself
under the disgraceful Chastisement he has undergone.
</p>

<p>
If your Curiosity is not yet satisfied,&mdash;I will now proceed to relate the
<i>Battle</i> of the Breeches, in the same exact Manner I have done <i>that</i>
of the Watch-Coat.
</p>

<p>
Be it known then, that, about ten Years ago, when <i>John</i> was appointed
Parish-Clerk of this Church, this said Master <i>Trim</i> took no small Pains
to get into <i>John</i>&rsquo;s good Graces in order, as it afterwards
appeared, to coax a Promise out of him of a Pair of Breeches, which <i>John</i>
had then by him, of black Plush, not much the worse for
wearing;&mdash;<i>Trim</i> only begging for God&rsquo;s Sake to have them
bestowed upon him when <i>John</i> should think fit to cast them.
</p>

<p>
<i>Trim</i> was one of those kind of Men who loved a Bit of Finery in his
Heart, and would rather have a tatter&rsquo;d Rag of a Better Body&rsquo;s,
than the best plain whole Thing his Wife could spin him.
</p>

<p>
<i>John</i>, who was naturally unsuspicious, made no more Difficulty of
promising the Breeches, than the Parson had done in promising the Great Coat;
and, indeed, with something less Reserve,&mdash;because the Breeches were
<i>John&rsquo;s own</i>, and he could give them, without Wrong, to whom he
thought fit.
</p>

<p>
It happened, I was going to say unluckily, but, I should rather say, most
luckily, for <i>Trim</i>, for he was the only Gainer by it;&mdash;that a
Quarrel, about some six or eight Weeks after this, broke out between <i>the
late</i> Parson of the Parish and <i>John</i> the Clerk. Somebody (and it was
thought to be Nobody but <i>Trim</i>) had put it into the Parson&rsquo;s Head,
&ldquo;That <i>John</i>&rsquo;s Desk in the Church was, at the least, four
Inches higher than it should be:&mdash;That the Thing gave Offence, and was
indecorous, inasmuch as it approach&rsquo;d too near upon a Level with the
Parson&rsquo;s Desk itself.&rdquo; This Hardship the Parson complained of
loudly,&mdash;and told <i>John</i> one Day after Prayers, &ldquo;He could bear
it no longer:&mdash;And would have it alter&rsquo;d and brought down as it
should be.&rdquo; <i>John</i> made no other Reply, but, &ldquo;That the Desk
was not of his raising:&mdash;That &rsquo;twas not one Hair Breadth higher than
he found it;&mdash;and that as he found it, so would he leave it:&mdash;In
short, he would neither make an Encroachment, nor would he suffer one.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The <i>late</i> Parson might have his Virtues, but the leading Part of his
Character was not <i>Humility;</i> so that <i>John</i>&rsquo;s Stiffness in
this Point was not likely to reconcile Matters.&mdash;This was
<i>Trim</i>&rsquo;s Harvest.
</p>

<p>
After a friendly Hint to <i>John</i> to stand his Ground,&mdash;away hies
<i>Trim</i> to make his Market at the Vicarage: What pass&rsquo;d there, I will
not say, intending not to be uncharitable; so shall content myself with only
guessing at it, from the sudden Change that appeared in <i>Trim</i>&rsquo;s
Dress for the better;&mdash;for he had left his old ragged Coat, Hat and Wig,
in the Stable, and was come forth strutting across the Church-yard,
y&rsquo;clad in a good creditable cast Coat, large Hat and Wig, which the
Parson had just given him.&mdash;Ho! Ho! Hollo! <i>John!</i> cries <i>Trim</i>,
in an insolent Bravo, as loud as ever he could bawl&mdash;See here, my Lad! how
fine I am.&mdash;The more Shame for you, answered <i>John</i>,
seriously.&mdash;Do you think, <i>Trim</i>, says he, such Finery, gain&rsquo;d
by such Services, becomes you, or can wear well?&mdash;Fye upon it,
<i>Trim;</i>&mdash;I could not have expected this from you, considering what
Friendship you pretended, and how kind I have ever been to you:&mdash;How many
Shillings and Sixpences I have generously lent you in your
Distresses?&mdash;Nay, it was but t&rsquo;other Day that I promised you these
black Plush Breeches I have on.&mdash;Rot your Breeches, quoth <i>Trim;</i> for
<i>Trim</i>&rsquo;s Brain was half turn&rsquo;d with his new Finery:&mdash;Rot
your Breeches, says he, &mdash;I would not take them up, were they laid at my
Door;&mdash;give &rsquo;em, and be d&mdash;&mdash;d to you, to whom you like; I
would have you to know I can have a better Pair at the Parson&rsquo;s any Day
in the Week:&mdash;<i>John</i> told him plainly, as his Word had once
pass&rsquo;d him, he had a Spirit above taking Advantage of his Insolence, in
giving them away to another:&mdash;But, to tell him his Mind freely, he thought
he had got so many Favours of that Kind, and was so likely to get many more for
the same Services, of the Parson, that he had better give up the Breeches, with
good Nature, to some one who would be more thankful for them.
</p>

<p>
Here <i>John</i> mentioned <i>Mark Slender</i>, (who, it seems, the Day before,
had ask&rsquo;d <i>John</i> for &rsquo;em) not knowing they were under Promise
to <i>Trim</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;Come, <i>Trim</i>, says he, let poor <i>Mark</i>
have &rsquo;em,&mdash;You know he has not a Pair to his. A&mdash;&mdash;:
Besides, you see he is just of my Size, and they will fit him to a T; whereas,
if I give &rsquo;em to you,&mdash;look ye, they are not worth much; and,
besides, you could not get your Backside into them, if you had them, without
tearing them all to Pieces.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Every Tittle of this was most undoubtedly true; for <i>Trim</i>, you must know,
by foul Feeding, and playing the good Fellow at the Parson&rsquo;s, was grown
somewhat gross about the lower Parts, <i>if not higher:</i> So that, as all
<i>John</i> said upon the Occasion was fact, <i>Trim</i>, with much ado, and
after a hundred Hum&rsquo;s and Hah&rsquo;s, at last, out of mere Compassion to
Mark, <i>signs, seals, and delivers up</i> <b>all Right, Interest, and
Pretentions whatsoever, in and to the said breeches; thereby binding his Heirs,
Executors, Administrators, and Assignes, never more to call the said Claim in
Question.</b>
</p>

<p>
All this Renunciation was set forth in an ample Manner, to be in pure Pity to
<i>Mark</i>&rsquo;s Nakedness;&mdash;but the Secret was, <i>Trim</i> had an Eye
to, and firmly expected in his own Mind, the great Green Pulpit-Cloth and old
Velvet Cushion, which were that very Year to be taken down;&mdash;which, by the
Bye, could he have wheedled <i>John</i> a second Time out of &rsquo;em, as he
hoped, he had made up the Loss of his Breeches Seven-fold.
</p>

<p>
Now, you must know, this Pulpit-Cloth and Cushion were not in
<i>John</i>&rsquo;s Gift, but in the Church-Wardens,
<i>&amp;c.</i>&mdash;However, as I said above, that <i>John</i> was a leading
Man in the Parish, <i>Trim</i> knew he could help him to them if he
would:&mdash;But <i>John</i> had got a Surfeit of him;&mdash;so, when the
Pulpit-Cloth, &amp;c. were taken down, they were immediately given (<i>John</i>
having a great Say in it) to <i>William Doe</i>, who understood very well what
Use to make of them.
</p>

<p>
As for the old Breeches, poor <i>Mark Slender</i> lived to wear them but a
short Time, and they got into the Possession of <i>Lorry Slim</i>, an unlucky
Wight, by whom they are still worn;&mdash;in Truth, as you will guess, they are
very thin by this Time:&mdash;But <i>Lorry</i> has a light Heart; and what
recommends them to him, is this, that, as, thin as they are, he knows that
Trim, let him say what he will to the contrary, still envies the
<i>Possessor</i> of them,&mdash;and, with all his Pride, would be very glad to
wear them after <i>him</i>.
</p>

<p>
Upon this Footing have these Affairs slept quietly for near ten
Years,&mdash;and would have slept for ever, but for the unlucky Kicking-Bout;
which, as I said, has ripp&rsquo;d this Squabble up afresh: So that it was no
longer ago than last Week, that <i>Trim</i> met and insulted <i>John</i> in the
public Town- Way, before a hundred People;&mdash;tax&rsquo;d him with the
Promise of the old-cast-Pair-of-black-Breeches, notwithstanding
<i>Trim</i>&rsquo;s solemn Renunciation; twitted him with the Pulpit-Cloth and
Velvet Cushion,&mdash;as good as told him, he was ignorant of the common Duties
of his Clerkship; adding, very insolently, That he knew not so much as to give
out a common Psalm in Tune.&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<i>John</i> contented himself with giving a plain Answer to every Article that
<i>Trim</i> had laid to his Charge, and appealed to his Neighbours who
remembered the whole Affair;&mdash;and as he knew there was never any Thing to
be got in wrestling with a Chimney-Sweeper,&mdash;he was going to take Leave of
<i>Trim</i> for ever.&mdash;But, hold,&mdash;the Mob by this Time had got round
them, and their High Mightinesses insisted upon having <i>Trim</i> tried upon
the Spot.&mdash;<i>Trim</i> was accordingly tried; and, after a full Hearing,
was convicted a second Time, and handled more roughly by one or more of them,
than even at the Parson&rsquo;s.
</p>

<p>
<i>Trim</i>, says one, are you not ashamed of yourself, to make all this Rout
and Disturbance in the Town, and set Neighbours together by the Ears, about an
old-worn-out-Pair-of-cast-Breeches, not worth Half a Crown?&mdash;Is there a
cast-Coat, or a Place in the whole Town, that will bring you in a Shilling, but
what you have snapp&rsquo;d up, like a greedy Hound as you are?
</p>

<p>
In the first Place, are you not Sexton and Dog-Whipper, worth Three Pounds a
Year?&mdash;Then you begg&rsquo;d the Church-Wardens to let your Wife have the
Washing and Darning of the Surplice and Church-Linen, which brings you in
Thirteen Shillings and Four Pence.&mdash;Then you have Six Shillings and Eight
Pence for oiling and winding up the Clock, both paid you at
<i>Easter</i>.&mdash;The Pinder&rsquo;s Place, which is worth Forty Shillings a
Year,&mdash;you have got that too.&mdash;You are the Bailiff, which the late
Parson got you, which brings you in Forty Shillings more.&mdash;Besides all
this, you have Six Pounds a Year, paid you Quarterly for being Mole-Catcher to
the Parish.&mdash;Aye, says the luckless Wight above-mentioned, (who was
standing close to him with his Plush Breeches on) &ldquo;You are not only
Mole-Catcher, <i>Trim</i>, but you catch S<small>TRAY</small>
C<small>ONIES</small> too in the <i>Dark;</i> and you pretend a <i>Licence</i>
for it, which, I trove, will be look&rsquo;d into at the next Quarter
Sessions.&rdquo; I maintain it, I have a Licence, says <i>Trim</i>, blushing as
red as Scarlet:&mdash;I have a Licence,&mdash;and as I farm a Warren in the
next Parish, I will catch Conies every Hour of the Night.&mdash;<i>You catch
Conies!</i> cries a toothless old Woman, who was just passing by.&mdash;
</p>

<p>
This set the Mob a laughing, and sent every Man home in perfect good Humour,
except <i>Trim</i>, who waddled very slowly off with that Kind of inflexible
Gravity only to be equalled by one Animal in the whole Creation,&mdash;and
surpassed by none, I am,

<h2>POSTSCRIPT.</h2>

<p>
I have broke open my Letter to inform you, that I miss&rsquo;d the Opportunity
of sending it by the Messenger, who I expected would have called upon me in his
Return through this Village to <i>York</i>, so it has laid a Week or ten Days
by me.
</p>

<p>
&mdash;I am not sorry for the Disappointment, because something has since
happened, in Continuation of this Affair, which I am thereby enabled to
transmit to you, all under one Trouble.
</p>

<p>
When I finished the above Account, I thought (as did every Soul in the Parish)
<i>Trim</i> had met with so thorough a Rebuff from <i>John</i> the Parish-Clerk
and the Town&rsquo;s Folks, who all took against him, that <i>Trim</i> would be
glad to be quiet, and let the Matter rest.
</p>

<p>
But, it seems, it is not half an Hour ago since <i>Trim</i> sallied forth
again; and, having borrowed a Sow-Gelder&rsquo;s Horn, with hard Blowing he got
the whole Town round him, and endeavoured to raise a Disturbance, and fight the
whole Battle over again:&mdash;That he had been used in the last Fray worse
than a Dog;&mdash;not by <i>John</i> the Parish-Clerk,&mdash;for I shou&rsquo;d
not, quoth <i>Trim</i>, have valued him a Rush single Hands:&mdash;But all the
Town sided with him, and twelve Men in Buckram set upon me all at once, and
kept me in Play at Sword&rsquo;s Point for three Hours together.&mdash;Besides,
quoth Trim, there were two misbegotten Knaves in <i>Kendal Green</i>, who lay
all the while in Ambush in <i>John</i>&rsquo;s own House, and they all sixteen
came upon my Back, and let drive at me together.&mdash;A Plague, says
<i>Trim</i>, of all Cowards!&mdash;<i>Trim</i> repeated this Story above a
Dozen Times;&mdash;which made some of the Neighbours pity him, thinking the
poor Fellow crack-brain&rsquo;d, and that he actually believed what he said.
After this <i>Trim</i> dropp&rsquo;d the Affair of the <i>Breeches</i>, and
begun a fresh Dispute about the <i>Reading-Desk</i>, which I told you had
occasioned some small Dispute between the <i>late</i> Parson and <i>John</i>,
some Years ago.
</p>

<p>
This <i>Reading-Desk</i>, as you will observe, was but an Episode wove into the
main Story by the Bye;&mdash;for the main Affair was the <i>Battle of the
Breeches</i> and <i>Great Watch-Coat</i>.&mdash;However, <i>Trim</i> being at
last driven out of these two Citadels,&mdash;he has seized hold, in his
Retreat, of this <i>Reading-Desk</i>, with a View, as it seems, to take Shelter
behind it.
</p>

<p>
I cannot say but the Man has fought it out obstinately enough;&mdash;and, had
his Cause been good, I should have really pitied him. For when he was driven
out of the <i>Great Watch-Coat</i>,&mdash;you see, he did not run
away;&mdash;no, &mdash;he retreated behind the <i>Breeches;</i>&mdash;and, when
he could make nothing of it behind the <i>Breeches</i>,&mdash;he got behind the
<i>Reading-Desk</i>.&mdash;To what other Hold Trim will next retreat, the
Politicians of this Village are not agreed.&mdash;Some think his next Move will
be towards the Rear of the Parson&rsquo;s Boot;&mdash;but, as it is thought he
cannot make a long Stand there,&mdash;others are of Opinion, That <i>Trim</i>
will once more in his Life get hold of the Parson&rsquo;s Horse, and charge
upon him, or perhaps behind him. But as the Horse is not easy to be caught, the
more general Opinion is, That, when he is driven out of the
<i>Reading-Desk</i>, he will make his last Retreat in such a Manner as, if
possible, to gain the <i>Close-Stool</i>, and defend himself behind it to the
very last Drop. If <i>Trim</i> should make this Movement, by my Advice he
should be left besides his Citadel, in full Possession of the Field of
Battle;&mdash;where, &rsquo;tis certain, he will keep every Body a League off,
and may pop by himself till he is weary: Besides, as <i>Trim</i> seems bent
upon <i>purging</i> himself, and may have Abundance of foul Humours to work
off, I think he cannot be better placed.
</p>

<p>
But this is all Matter of Speculation.&mdash;Let me carry you back to Matter of
Fact, and tell you what Kind of a Stand <i>Trim</i> has actually made behind
the said <i>Desk</i>.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Neighbours and Townsmen all, I will be sworn before my Lord Mayor, That
<i>John</i> and his nineteen Men in <i>Buckram</i>, have abused me worse than a
Dog; for they told you that I play&rsquo;d fast and go-loose with the
<i>late</i> Parson and him, in that old Dispute of theirs about the
<i>Reading-Desk;</i> and that I made Matters worse between them, and not
better.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Of this Charge, <i>Trim</i> declared he was as innocent as the Child that was
unborn: That he would be Book-sworn he had no Hand in it. He produced a strong
Witness;&mdash;and, moreover, insinuated, that <i>John</i> himself, instead of
being angry for what he had done in it, had actually thank&rsquo;d him. Aye,
<i>Trim</i>, says the Wight in the Plush Breeches, but that was, <i>Trim</i>,
the Day before <i>John</i> found thee out.&mdash;Besides, <i>Trim</i>, there is
nothing in that:&mdash;For, the very Year that thou wast made Town&rsquo;s
Pinder, thou knowest well, that I both thank&rsquo;d thee myself; and,
moreover, gave thee a good warm Supper for turning <i>John Lund</i>&rsquo;s
Cows and Horses out of my Hard-Corn Close; which if thou had&rsquo;st not done,
(as thou told&rsquo;st me) I should have lost my whole Crop: Whereas, <i>John
Lund</i> and <i>Thomas Patt</i>, who are both here to testify, and will take
their Oaths on&rsquo;t, That thou thyself wast the very Man who set the Gate
open; and, after all,&mdash;it was not thee, <i>Trim</i>,&mdash;&rsquo;twas the
Blacksmith&rsquo;s poor Lad who turn&rsquo;d them out: So that a Man may be
thank&rsquo;d and rewarded too for a good Turn which he never did, nor ever did
intend.
</p>

<p>
<i>Trim</i> could not sustain this unexpected Stroke;&mdash;so <i>Trim</i>
march&rsquo;d off the Field, without Colours flying, or his Horn sounding, or
any other Ensigns of Honour whatever.
</p>

<p>
Whether after this <i>Trim</i> intends to rally a second Time, or whether
<i>Trim</i> may not take it into his Head to claim the Victory,&mdash;no one
but <i>Trim</i> himself can inform you:&mdash;However, the general Opinion,
upon the whole, is this, That, in three several pitch&rsquo;d Battles,
<i>Trim</i> has been so trimm&rsquo;d, as never disastrous Hero was
<i>trimm&rsquo;d</i> before him.

<h2>THE KEY.</h2>

<p>
This <i>Romance</i> was, by some Mischance or other, dropp&rsquo;d in the
<i>Minster-Yard, York</i>, and pick&rsquo;d up by a Member of a small Political
Club in that City; where it was carried, and publickly read to the Members the
last Club Night.
</p>

<p>
It was instantly agreed to, by a great Majority, That it was a <i>Political
Romance;</i> but concerning what State or Potentate, could not so easily be
settled amongst them.
</p>

<p>
The President of the Night, who is thought to be as clear and quick-lighted as
any one of the whole Club in Things of this Nature, discovered plainly, That
the Disturbances therein set forth, related to those on the
<i>Continent:</i>&mdash;That <i>Trim</i> could be Nobody but the King of
<i>France</i>, by whole shifting and intriguing Behaviour, all <i>Europe</i>
was set together by the Ears:&mdash;That <i>Trim</i>&rsquo;s Wife was certainly
the <i>Empress</i>, who are as kind together, says he, as any Man and Wife can
be for their Lives.&mdash;The more Shame for &rsquo;em, says an Alderman, low
to himself.&mdash;Agreeable to this Key, continues the President,&mdash;The
<i>Parson</i>, who I think is a most excellent Character,&mdash;is His Most
Excellent Majesty King <i>George;</i>&mdash;<i>John</i>, the Parish-Clerk, is
the King of <i>Prussia;</i> who, by the Manner of his first entering
<i>Saxony</i>, shew&rsquo;d the World most evidently,&mdash;That he did know
how to lead out the Psalm, and in Tune and Time too, notwithstanding
<i>Trim</i>&rsquo;s vile Insult upon him in that Particular.&mdash;But who do
you think, says a Surgeon and Man-Midwife, who sat next him, (whose Coat-Button
the President, in the Earnestness of this Explanation, had got fast hold of,
and had thereby partly drawn him over to his Opinion) Who do you think, Mr.
President, says he, are meant by the <i>Church-Wardens, Sides-Men, Mark
Slender, Lorry Slim, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;Who do I think? says he, Why,&mdash;Why,
Sir, as I take the Thing,&mdash;the <i>Church-Wardens</i> and <i>Sides-Men</i>,
are the <i>Electors</i> and the other <i>Princes</i> who form the <i>Germanick
Body</i>.&mdash;And as for the other subordinate Characters of <i>Mark
Slim?</i>&mdash;the <i>unlucky Wight</i> in the Plush Breeches,&mdash;the
<i>Parson&rsquo;s Man</i> who was so often out of the Way, &amp;c.
&amp;c.&mdash;these, to be sure, are the several <i>Marshals</i> and
<i>Generals</i>, who fought, or should have fought, under them the last
Campaign.&mdash;The Men in <i>Buckram</i>, continued the President, are the
Grofs of the King of <i>Prussia</i>&rsquo;s Army, who are as <i>stiff</i> a
Body of Men as are in the World:&mdash;And <i>Trim</i>&rsquo;s saying they were
twelve, and then nineteen, is a Wipe for the <i>Brussels Gazetteer</i>, who, to
my Knowledge, was never two Weeks in the same Story, about that or any thing
else.
</p>

<p>
As for the rest of the <i>Romance</i>, continued the President, it sufficiently
explains itself,&mdash;The <i>Old-cast-Pair-of-Black-Plush-Breeches</i> must be
<i>Saxony</i>, which the <i>Elector</i>, you see, <i>has left of
wearing:</i>&mdash;And as for the <i>Great Watch-Coat</i>, which, you know,
covers all, it signifies all <i>Europe;</i> comprehending, at least, so many of
its different States and Dominions, as we have any Concern with in the present
War.
</p>

<p>
I protest, says a Gentleman who sat next but one to the President, and who, it
seems, was the Parson of the Parish, a Member not only of the Political, but
also of a Musical Club in the next Street;&mdash;I protest, says he, if this
Explanation is right, which I think it is, That the whole makes a very fine
Symbol.&mdash;You have always some Musical Instrument or other in your Head, I
think, says the Alderman.&mdash;Musical instrument! replies the Parson, in
Astonishment,&mdash;Mr. Alderman, I mean an Allegory; and I think the greedy
Disposition of <i>Trim</i> and his Wife, in ripping the <i>Great Watch-Coat</i>
to Pieces, in order to convert it into a Petticoat for the one, and a Jerkin
for the other, is one of the most beautiful of the Kind I ever met with; and
will shew all the World what have been the true Views and Intentions of the
Houses of <i>Bourbon</i> and <i>Austria</i> in this abominable
Coalition,&mdash;I might have called it Whoredom:&mdash;Nay, says the Alderman,
&rsquo;tis downright Adulterydom, or nothing.
</p>

<p>
This Hypothesis of the President&rsquo;s explain&rsquo;d every Thing in the
<i>Romance</i> extreamly well; and, withall, was delivered with so much
Readiness and Air of Certainty, as begot an Opinion in two Thirds of the Club,
that Mr. President was actually the Author of the <i>Romance</i> himself: But a
Gentleman who sat on the opposite Side of the Table, who had come piping-hot
from reading the History of King <i>William</i>&rsquo;s and Queen
<i>Anne</i>&rsquo;s Wars, and who was thought, at the Bottom, to envy the
President the Honour both of the <i>Romance</i> and Explanation too, gave an
entire new Turn to it all. He acquainted the Club, That Mr. President was
altogether wrong in every Supposition he had made, except that one, where the
<i>Great Watch-Coat</i> was said by him to represent <i>Europe</i>, or at least
a great Part of it:&mdash;So far he acknowledged he was pretty right; but that
he had not gone far enough backwards into our History to come at the Truth. He
then acquainted them, that the dividing the <i>Great Watch-Coat</i> did, and
could, allude to nothing else in the World but the <i>Partition-Treaty;</i>
which, by the Bye, he told them, was the most unhappy and scandalous
Transaction in all King <i>William</i>&rsquo;s Life: It was that false Step,
and that only, says he, rising from his Chair, and striking his Hand upon the
Table with great Violence; it was that false Step, says he, knitting his Brows
and throwing his Pipe down upon the Ground, that has laid the Foundation of all
the Disturbances and Sorrows we feel and lament at this very Hour; and as for
<i>Trim</i>&rsquo;s giving up the <i>Breeches</i>, look ye, it is almost Word
for Word copied from the <i>French</i> King and <i>Dauphin</i>&rsquo;s
Renunciation of <i>Spain</i> and the <i>West-Indies</i>, which all the World
knew (as was the very Case of the <i>Breeches</i>) were renounced by them on
purpose to be reclaim&rsquo;d when Time should serve.
</p>

<p>
This Explanation had too much Ingenuity in it to be altogether slighted; and,
in Truth, the worst Fault it had, seem&rsquo;d to be the prodigious Heat of it;
which (as an Apothecary, who sat next the Fire, observ&rsquo;d, in a very low
Whisper to his next Neighbour) was so much incorporated into every Particle of
it, that it was impossible, under such Fermentation, it should work its defined
Effect.
</p>

<p>
This, however, no way intimidated a little valiant Gentleman, though he sat the
very next Man, from giving an Opinion as diametrically opposite as <i>East</i>
is from <i>West</i>.
</p>

<p>
This Gentleman, who was by much the best Geographer in the whole Club, and,
moreover, second Cousin to an Engineer, was positive the <i>Breeches</i> meant
<i>Gibraltar;</i> for, if you remember, Gentlemen, says he, tho&rsquo; possibly
you don&rsquo;t, the Ichnography and Plan of that Town and Fortress, it exactly
resembles a Pair of Trunk-Hose, the two Promontories forming the two Slops,
&amp;c. &amp;c.&mdash;Now we all know, continued he, that King <i>George</i>
the First made a Promise of that important Pass to the King of
<i>Spain:</i>&mdash;So that the whole Drift of the <i>Romance</i>, according to
my Sense of Things, is merely to vindicate the King and the Parliament in that
Transaction, which made so much Noise in the World.
</p>

<p>
A Wholesale Taylor, who from the Beginning had resolved not to speak at all in
the Debate,&mdash;was at last drawn into it, by something very unexpected in
the last Person&rsquo;s Argument.
</p>

<p>
He told the Company, frankly, he did not understand what <i>Ichnography</i>
meant:&mdash;But as for the Shape of a <i>Pair of Breeches</i>, as he had had
the Advantage of cutting out so many hundred Pairs in his Life-Time, he hoped
he might be allowed to know as much of the Matter as another Man.
</p>

<p>
Now, to my Mind, says he, there is nothing in all the Terraqueous Globe (a Map
of which, it seems, hung up in his Work-Shop) so like a <i>Pair of Breeches</i>
unmade up, as the Island of <i>Sicily:</i>&mdash;Nor is there any thing, if you
go to that, quoth an honest Shoe-maker, who had the Honour to be a Member of
the Club, so much like a <i>Jack-Boot</i>, to my Fancy, as the Kingdom of
<i>Italy</i>.&mdash;What the Duce has either <i>Italy</i> or <i>Sicily</i> to
do in the Affair? cries the President, who, by this Time, began to tremble for
his Hypothesis,&mdash;What have they to do?&mdash;Why, answered the
<i>Partition-Treaty</i> Gentleman, with great Spirit and Joy sparkling in his
Eyes,&mdash;They have just so much, Sir, to do in the Debate as to overthrow
your Suppositions, and to establish the Certainty of mine beyond the
Possibility of a Doubt: For, says he, (with an Air of Sovereign Triumph over
the President&rsquo;s Politicks)&mdash;By the <i>Partition-Treaty</i>, Sir,
both <i>Naples</i> and <i>Sicily</i> were the very Kingdoms made to devolve
upon the <i>Dauphin;</i>&mdash;and <i>Trim</i>&rsquo;s <i>greasing the
Parson&rsquo;s Boots</i>, is a Devilish Satyrical Stroke;&mdash;for it exposes
the Corruption, and Bribery made Use of at that Juncture, in bringing over the
several States and Princes of <i>Italy</i> to use their Interests at
<i>Rome</i>, to stop the Pope from giving the Investitures of those Kingdoms to
any Body else.&mdash;The Pope has not the Investiture of <i>Sicily</i>, cries
another Gentleman.&mdash;I care not, says he, for
that.
</p>

<p>
Almost every one apprehended the Debate to be now ended, and that no one Member
would venture any new Conjecture upon the <i>Romance</i>, after so many clear
and decisive Interpretations had been given. But, hold,&mdash;Close to the
Fire, and opposite to where the Apothecary sat, there sat also a Gentleman of
the Law, who, from the Beginning to the End of the Hearing of this Case,
seem&rsquo;d no way satisfied in his Conscience with any one Proceeding in it.
This Gentleman had not yet opened his Mouth, but had waited patiently till they
had all gone thro&rsquo; their several Evidences on the other
Side;&mdash;reserving himself, like an expert Practitioner, for the last Word
in the Debate. When the <i>Partition-Treaty</i>-Gentleman had finish&rsquo;d
what he had to say,&mdash;He got up,&mdash;and, advancing towards the Table,
told them, That the Error they had all gone upon thus far, in making out the
several Facts in the <i>Romance</i>,&mdash;was in looking too high; which, with
great Candor, he said, was a very natural Thing, and very excusable withall, in
such a Political Club as theirs: For Instance, continues he, you have been
searching the <i>Registers</i>, and looking into the <i>Deeds</i> of
<i>Kings</i> and <i>Emperors</i>,&mdash;as if Nobody had any <i>Deeds</i> to
shew or compare the <i>Romance</i> to but themselves.&mdash;This, continued the
Attorney, is just as much out of the Way of good Practice, as if I should carry
a Thing slap-dash into the House of Lords, which was under forty Shillings, and
might be decided in the next County-Court for six Shillings and
Eight-pence.&mdash;He then took the <i>Romance</i> in his Left Hand, and
pointing with the Fore-Finger of his Right towards the second Page, he humbly
begg&rsquo;d Leave to observe, (and, to do him Justice, he did it in somewhat
of a <i>forensic Air</i>) That the <i>Parson, John</i>, and <i>Sexton</i>,
shewed incontestably the Thing to be <i>Tripartite;</i> now, if you will take
Notice, Gentlemen, says he, these several Persons, who are Parties to this
Instrument, are merely Ecclesiastical; that the <i>Reading-Desk,
Pulpit-Cloth</i>, and <i>Velvet Cushion</i>, are tripartite too; and are, by
Intendment of Law, Goods and Chattles merely of an Ecclesiastick Nature,
belonging and appertaining &lsquo;only unto them,&rsquo; <i>and to them
only</i>.&mdash;So that it appears very plain to me, That the <i>Romance</i>,
neither directly nor indirectly, goes upon Temporal, but altogether upon
Church-Matters.&mdash;And do not you think, says he, softening his Voice a
little, and addressing himself to the Parson with a forced Smile,&mdash;Do not
you think Doctor, says he, That the Dispute in the <i>Romance</i>, between the
<i>Parson</i> of the Parish and <i>John</i>, about the Height of
<i>John</i>&rsquo;s Desk, is a very fine Panegyrick upon the <i>Humility of
Church-Men?</i>&mdash;I think, says the Parson, it is much of the same Fineness
with that which your Profession is complimented with, in the pimping, dirty,
pettyfogging Character of <i>Trim</i>,&mdash;which, in my Opinion, Sir, is just
such another Panegyrick upon the <i>Honesty</i> of <i>Attornies</i>.
</p>

<p>
Nothing whets the Spirits like an Insult:&mdash;Therefore the Parson went on
with a visible Superiority and an uncommon Acuteness.&mdash;As you are so
happy, Sir, continues he, in making Applications,&mdash;pray turn over a Page
or two to the black Law-Letters in the <i>Romance</i>.&mdash;What do you think
of them, Sir?&mdash;Nay,&mdash;pray read the Grant of the <i>Great
Watch-Coat</i> and <i>Trim</i>&rsquo;s Renunciation of the
<i>Breeches</i>.&mdash;Why, there is downright <b>Lease</b> and <b>Release</b>
for you,&mdash;&rsquo;tis the very Thing, Man;&mdash;only with this small
Difference,&mdash;and in which consists the whole Strength of the Panegyric,
That the Author of the <i>Romance</i> has convey&rsquo;d and re-convey&rsquo;d,
in about ten Lines, &mdash;what you, with the glorious Prolixity of the Law,
could not have crowded into as many Skins of Parchment.
</p>

<p>
The Apothecary, who had paid the Attorney, the same Afternoon, a Demand of
Three Pounds Six Shillings and Eight-Pence, for much such another
Jobb,&mdash;was so highly tickled with the Parson&rsquo;s Repartee in that
particular Point,&mdash;that he rubb&rsquo;d his Hands together most
fervently,&mdash;and laugh&rsquo;d most triumphantly thereupon.
</p>

<p>
This could not escape the Attorney&rsquo;s Notice, any more than the Cause of
it did escape his Penetration.
</p>

<p>
I think, Sir, says he, (dropping his Voice a Third) you might well have spared
this immoderate Mirth, since you and your Profession have the least Reason to
triumph here of any of us.&mdash;I beg, quoth he, that you would reflect a
Moment upon the <i>Cob-Web</i> which <i>Trim</i> went so far for, and brought
back with an Air of so much Importance, in his Breeches Pocket, to lay upon the
Parson&rsquo;s cut Finger.&mdash;This said Cob-Web, Sir, is a fine-spun Satyre,
upon the flimsy Nature of one Half of the Shop-Medicines, with which you make a
Property of the Sick, the Ignorant, and the Unsuspecting.&mdash;And as for the
Moral of the <i>Close-Stool-Pan</i>, Sir, &rsquo;tis too plain, Does not nine
Parts in ten of the whole Practice, and of all you vend under <i>its
Colours</i>, pass into and concenter in that one nasty Utensil?&mdash;And let
me tell you, Sir, says he, raising his Voice,&mdash;had not your unseasonable
Mirth blinded you, you might have seen that <i>Trim</i>&rsquo;s carrying the
Close-Stool-Pan upon his Head the whole Length of the Town, without blushing,
is a pointed Raillery,&mdash;and one of the sharpest Sarcasms, Sir, that ever
was thrown out upon you;&mdash;for it unveils the solemn Impudence of the whole
Profession, who, I see, are ashamed of nothing which brings in Money.
</p>

<p>
There were two Apothecaries in the Club, besides the Surgeon mentioned before,
with a Chemist and an Undertaker, who all felt themselves equally hurt and
aggrieved by this discourteous Retort:&mdash;And they were all five rising up
together from their Chairs, with full Intent of Heart, as it was thought, to
return the <i>Reproof Valiant</i> thereupon.&mdash;But the President, fearing
it would end in a general Engagement, he instantly call&rsquo;d out, <i>To
Order;</i>&mdash;and gave Notice, That if there was any Member in the Club, who
had not yet spoke, and yet did desire to speak upon the main Subject of the
Debate,&mdash;that he should immediately be heard.
</p>

<p>
This was a happy Invitation for a stammering Member, who, it seems, had but a
weak Voice at the best; and having often attempted to speak in the Debate, but
to no Purpose, had sat down in utter Despair of an Opportunity.
</p>

<p>
This Member, you must know, had got a sad Crush upon his Hip, in the late
<i>Election</i>, which gave him intolerable Anguish;&mdash;so that, in short,
he could think of nothing else:&mdash;For which Cause, and others, he was
strongly of Opinion, That the whole <i>Romance</i> was a just Gird at the late
<i>York</i> Election; and I think, says he, that the <i>Promise</i> of the
<i>Breeches</i> broke, may well and truly signify <i>Somebody&rsquo;s else
Promise</i>, which was broke, and occasion&rsquo;d to much Disturbance amongst
us.
</p>

<p>
Thus every Man turn&rsquo;d the Story to what was swimming uppermost in his own
Brain;&mdash;so that, before all was over, there were full as many Satyres spun
out of it,&mdash;and as great a Variety of Personages, Opinions, Transactions,
and Truths, found to lay hid under the dark Veil of its Allegory, as ever were
discovered in the thrice-renowned History of the Acts of <i>Gargantua</i> and
<i>Pantagruel</i>.
</p>

<p>
At the Close of all, and just before the Club was going to break up,&mdash;Mr.
President rose from his Chair, and begg&rsquo;d Leave to make the two following
Motions, which were instantly agreed to, without any Division.
</p>

<p>
<i>First</i>, Gentlemen, says he, as <i>Trim</i>&rsquo;s Character in the
Romance, of a shuffling intriguing Fellow,&mdash;whoever it was drawn for, is,
in Truth, as like the <i>French King</i> as it can stare,&mdash;I move, That
the <i>Romance</i> be forthwith <i>printed:</i>&mdash;For, continues he, if we
can but once turn the Laugh against him, and make him asham&rsquo;d of what he
has done, it may be a great Means, with the Blessing of God upon our Fleets and
Armies, to save the Liberties of <i>Europe</i>.
</p>

<p>
In the <i>second</i> Place, I move, That Mr. Attorney, our worthy Member, be
desired to take Minutes, upon the Spot, of every Conjecture which has been made
upon the <i>Romance</i>, by the several Members who have spoke; which, I think,
says he, will answer two good Ends:
</p>

<p>
1<sup>st</sup>, It will establish the Political Knowledge of our Club for ever,
and place it in a respectable Light to all the World.
</p>

<p>
In the <i>next</i> Place, it will furnish what will be wanted; that is, a
<i>Key</i> to the <i>Romance</i>.&mdash;In troth you might have said a whole
Bunch of <i>Keys</i>, quoth a Whitesmith, who was the only Member in the Club
who had not said something in the Debate: But let me tell you, Mr. President,
says he, That the <i>Right Key</i>, if it could but be found, would be worth
the whole Bunch put together.
</p>

SIR,

<p>
You write me Word that the Letter I wrote to you, and now stiled <i>The

Carelessness, to make some Amends, you will overlook the Printing of it
yourself, and take Care to see that it comes right into the World.

<p>
I was just going to return you Thanks, and to beg, withal, you would take Care
That the Child be not laid at my Door.&mdash;But having, this Moment, perused
the <i>Reply</i> to the <i>Dean</i> of <i>York</i>&rsquo;s
<i>Answer</i>,&mdash;it has made me alter my Mind in that respect; so that,
instead of making you the Request I intended, I do here desire That the Child
be filiated upon me, <i>Laurence Sterne</i>, Prebendary of <i>York</i>, &amp;c.
&amp;c. And I do, accordingly, own it for my own true and lawful Offspring.
</p>

<p>
My Reason for this is plain;&mdash;for as, you see, the <i>Writer</i> of that
<i>Reply</i>, has taken upon him to invade this <i>incontested Right</i> of
another Man&rsquo;s in a Thing of this Kind, it is high Time for every Man to
look to his own&mdash;Since, upon the <i>same Grounds</i>, and with half the
Degree of Anger, that he affirms the Production of that very Reverend
Gentleman&rsquo;s, to be the Child of many Fathers, some one in his Spight (for
I am not without my Friends of that Stamp) may run headlong into the other
Extream, and swear, That mine had no Father at all:&mdash;And therefore, to
make use of <i>Bay</i>&rsquo;s Plea in the <i>Rehearsal</i>, for <i>Prince
Pretty-Man;</i> I merely do it, as he says, &ldquo;for fear it should be said
to be no Body&rsquo;s Child at all.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I have only to add two Things:&mdash;First, That, at your Peril, you do not
presume to alter or transpose one Word, nor rectify one false Spelling, nor so
much as add or diminish one Comma or Tittle, in or to my
<i>Romance:</i>&mdash;For if you do,&mdash;In case any of the Descendents of
<i>Curl</i> should think fit to invade my Copy-Right, and print it over again
in my Teeth, I may not be able, in a Court of Justice, to swear strictly to my
own Child, after you had <i>so large a Share</i> in the begetting it.
</p>

<p>
In the next Place, I do not approve of your <i>quaint Conceit</i> at the Foot
of the Title Page of my <i>Romance</i>,&mdash;It would only set People on
finding a Page or two before I give them Leave;&mdash;and besides, all Attempts
either at Wit or Humour, in that Place, are a Forestalling of what slender
Entertainment of those Kinds are prepared within: Therefore I would have it
stand thus:
</p>

<p class="center">
YORK:<br />Printed in the Year 1759.<br />(<i>Price One Shilling</i>.)
</p>

<p>
I know you will tell me, That it is set too high; and as a Proof, you will say,
That this last <i>Reply</i> to the <i>Dean</i>&rsquo;s <i>Answer</i> does
consist of near as many Pages as mine; and yet is all sold for
Six-pence.&mdash;But mine, my dear Friend, is quite a <i>different
Story:</i>&mdash;It is a Web wrought out of my own Brain, of twice the Fineness
of this which he has spun out of his; and besides, I maintain it, it is of a
more curious Pattern, and could not be afforded at the Price that his is sold
at, by any <i>honest</i> Workman in <i>Great-Britain</i>.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, Sir, you do not consider, That the Writer is interested in his
<i>Story</i>, and that it is his Business to set it a-going at <i>any
Price:</i> And indeed, from the Information of Persons conversant in Paper and
Print, I have very good Reason to believe, if he should sell every Pamphlet of
them, he would inevitably be a <i>Great Loser</i> by it, This I believe verily,
and am,

<h2>To Dr. TOPHAM.</h2>

<p class="letter">
SIR,
</p>

<p>
Though the <i>Reply</i> to the <i>Dean</i> of <i>York</i> is not declared, in
the <i>Title-Page</i>, or elsewhere, to be wrote by you,&mdash;Yet I take that
Point for granted; and therefore beg Leave, in this public Manner, to write to
you in Behalf of myself; with Intent to set you right in two Points where I
stand concerned in this Affair; and which I find you have misapprehended, and
consequently (as I hope) misrepresented.
</p>

<p>
The <i>First</i> is, in respect of some Words, made use of in the Instrument,
signed by D<sup>r</sup> <i>Herring</i>, M<sup>r</sup> <i>Berdmore</i> and
myself.&mdash;Namely, <i>to the best of our Remembrance and Belief,</i> which
Words you have caught hold of, as implying some Abatement of our Certainty as
to the Facts therein attested. Whether it was so with the other two Gentlemen
who signed that Attestation with me, it is not for me to say; they are able to
answer for themselves, and I desire to do so for myself; and therefore I
declare to you, and to all Mankind, That the Words in the first Paragraph,
<i>to the best of our Remembrance and Belief</i>, implied no Doubt remaining
upon my Mind, nor any Distrust whatever of my Memory, from the Distance of
Time;&mdash;Nor, in short, was it my Intention to attest the several Facts
therein, as Matters of Belief&mdash;But as Matters of as much Certainty as a
Man was capable of having, or giving Evidence to. In Consequence of this
Explanation of myself, I do declare myself ready to attest the same Instrument
over again, striking out the Words <i>to the best of our Remembrance and
Belief</i> which I see, have raised this Exception to it.
</p>

<p>
Whether I was mistaken or no, I leave to better Judges; but I understood those
Words were a very common Preamble to Attestations of Things, to which we bore
the clearest Evidence;&mdash;However, D<sup>r</sup> <i>Topham</i>, as you have
claimed just such another Indulgence yourself, in the Case of begging the
<i>Dean</i>&rsquo;s Authority to say, what, as you affirm, you had sufficient
Authority to say without, as a modest and Gentleman-like Way of
Affirmation;&mdash;I wish you had spared either the one or the other of your
Remarks upon these two Passages:&mdash;<i>Veniam petimus, demusque
vicissim</i>.
</p>

<p>
There is another Observation relating to this Instrument, which I perceive has
escaped your Notice; which I take the Liberty to point out to you, namely, That
the Words, <i>To the best of our Remembrance and Belief</i>, if they imply any
Abatement of Certainty, seem only confined to that Paragraph, and to what is
immediately attested after them in it:&mdash;For in the second Paragraph,
wherein the main Points are minutely attested, and upon which the whole
Dispute, and main Charge against the <i>Dean</i>, turns, it is introduced thus:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>We do particularly remember</i>, That as soon as Dinner was over,
&amp;c.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
In the second Place you affirm, &ldquo;That it is not said that Mr.
<i>Sterne</i> could affirm he had heard you charge the <i>Dean</i> with a
Promise, in its own Nature so very extraordinary, as of the Commissaryship of
the Dean and Chapter&rdquo;:&mdash;To this I answer, That my true Intent in
subscribing that very instrument, and I suppose of others, was to attest this
<i>very Thing;</i> and I have just now read that Part of the Instrument over;
and cannot, for my Life, affirm it either more directly or expresly, than in
the Words as they there stand;&mdash;therefore please to let me transcribe
them.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But being press&rsquo;d by Mr. <i>Sterne</i> with an undeniable Proof,
That he, (Dr. <i>Topham</i>) did propagate the said Story, (viz: <i>of a
Promise from the Dean to Dr.</i> Topham <i>of the Dean and Chapter&rsquo;s
Commissaryship</i>)&mdash;Dr. <i>Topham</i> did at last acknowledge it; adding,
as his Reason or Excuse for so doing, That he apprehended (or Words to that
Effect) he had a <i>Promise</i> under the <i>Dean&rsquo;s own Hand</i>, of the
<i>Dean and Chapter&rsquo;s Commissaryship</i>.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This I have attested, and what Weight the Sanction of an Oath will add to it, I
am willing and ready to give.
</p>

<p>
As for Mr. <i>Ricard</i>&rsquo;s feeble Attestation, brought to shake the
Credit of this firm and solemn one, I have nothing to say to it, as it is only
an Attestation of Mr. <i>Ricard</i>&rsquo;s Conjectures upon the
Subject.&mdash;But this I can say, That I had the Honour to be at the Deanery
with the learned Counsel, when Mr. <i>Ricard</i> underwent that <i>most
formidable</i> Examination you speak of,&mdash;and I solemnly affirm, That he
then said, He knew nothing at all about the Matter, one Way or the other; and
the Reasons he gave for his utter Ignorance, were, first, That he was then so
full of Concern, at the Difference which arose between two Gentlemen, both his
Friends, that he did not attend to the Subject Matter of it,&mdash;and of which
he declared again he knew nothing at all. And secondly, If he had understood it
then, the Distance would have put it out of his Head by this Time.
</p>

<p>
He has since scower&rsquo;d his Memory, I ween; for now he says, That he
apprehended the Dispute regarded something in the Dean&rsquo;s Gift, as he
could not <i>naturally</i> suppose, &amp;c. &rsquo;Tis certain, at the Deanery,
he had <i>naturally</i> no Suppositions in his Head about this Affair; so that
I with this may not prove one of the After-Thoughts you speak of, and not so
much a <i>natural</i> as an <i>artificial</i> Supposition of my good
Friend&rsquo;s.
</p>

<p>
As for the <i>formidable</i> Enquiry you represent him as undergoing,&mdash;let
me intreat you to give me Credit in what I say upon
it,&mdash;namely,&mdash;That it was as much the Reverse to every Idea that ever
was couch&rsquo;d under that Word, as Words can represent it to you. As for the
learned Counsel and myself, who were in the Room all the Time, I do not
remember that we, either of us, spoke ten Words. The Dean was the only one that
ask&rsquo;d Mr. <i>Ricard</i> what he remembered about the Affair of the
Sessions Dinner; which he did in the most Gentleman-like and candid
Manner,&mdash;and with an Air of as much Calmness and seeming Indifference, as
if he had been questioning him about the News in the last <i>Brussels
Gazette</i>.
</p>

<p>
What Mr. <i>Ricard</i> saw to terrify him so sadly, I cannot apprehend, unless
the Dean&rsquo;s <i>Gothic</i> Book-Case,&mdash;which I own has an odd
Appearance to a Stranger; so that if he came terrified in his Mind there, and
with a Resolution not to <i>plead</i>, he might <i>naturally suppose</i> it to
be a great Engine brought there on purpose to exercise the <i>Peine fort et
dure</i> upon him.&mdash;But to be serious; if Mr. <i>Ricard</i> told you, That
this Enquiry was <i>most formidable</i>, He was much to blame;&mdash;and if you
have said it, without his express Information, then <i>You</i> are much to
blame.
</p>

<p>
This is all, I think, in your <i>Reply</i>, which concerns me to
answer:&mdash;As for the many coarse and unchristian Insinuations
scatter&rsquo;d throughout your <i>Reply</i>,&mdash;as it is my Duty to beg God
to forgive you, so I do from my Heart: Believe me, Dr. <i>Topham</i>, they hurt
yourself more than the Person they are aimed at; and when the <i>first
Transport</i> of Rage is a little over, they will grieve you more too.
</p>

<p>
&mdash;<i>prima est hæc Ultio</i>.
</p>

<p>
But these I hold to be no answerable Part of a Controversy;&mdash;and for the
little that remains unanswered in yours,&mdash;I believe I could, in another
half Hour, set it right in the Eyes of the World: But this is not my
Business.&mdash;And is it is thought worth the while, which I hope it never
will, I know no one more able to do it than the very Reverend and Worthy
Gentleman whom you have so unhandsomely insulted upon that Score.
</p>

<p>
As for the <i>supposed Compilers</i>, whom you have been so wrath and so
unmerciful against, I&rsquo;ll be answerable for it, as they are Creatures of
your own Fancy, they will bear you no Malice. However, I think the more
positively any Charge is made, let it be against whom it will, the better it
should be supported; and therefore I should be sorry, for your own Honour, if
you have not some better Grounds for all you have thrown out about them, than
the mere Heat of your Imagination or Anger. To tell you truly, your
Suppositions on this Head oft put me in Mind of <i>Trim</i>&rsquo;s twelve Men
in <i>Buckram</i>, which his disordered Fancy represented as laying in Ambush
in <i>John</i> the Clerk&rsquo;s House, and letting drive at him all together.
I am,
</p>

<i>And most humble Servan</i>t,<br />

</p>

<p>
P.S. I beg Pardon for <i>clapping</i> this upon the <i>Back</i> of the
<i>Romance</i>,&mdash;which is done out of no Disrespect to you.&mdash;But the
<i>Vehicle</i> stood ready at the Door,&mdash;and as I was to pay the whole
Fare, and there was Room enough behind it,&mdash;it was the cheapest and
readiest Conveyance I could think of.
